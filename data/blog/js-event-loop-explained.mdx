## Overview

A good understanding of javascript execution flow helps developers to write better code.

Ok, let's talk about how the event loop works in javascript.

Javascript runs on a browser with the help of google's V8 engine to manipulate DOM inside webpages.
The webpage consists of different types of elements like buttons, text, images, etc..

Think from a user/client perspective. When a user opens a webpage that consists of buttons, text and images, and so on.
All the elements are loaded parallelly without waiting for other elements to load.

Did you ever wonder how this is happening?

Let's write some code to understand it better.

```js
// FUNCTION name called one
function one() {
  //log
  console.log('One')
}

// FUNCTION name called two
function Two() {
  //log
  console.log('Two')
}

// FUNCTION name called three
function Three() {
  //log
  console.log('Three')
}

one()
two()
three()
```

The above code is very simple and can easily predict the output.

Let's understand the exec flow when the above code runs. There are 3 function definitions and 3 function calls happening.

Every function is javascript executes inside call stack created by javascript engine. Whenever a function gets called it will be directly pushed into the call stack and executes the code line by line.

Once execution completes, the function gets popped out of the stack.

### Now the most interesting part of our overall discussion. How do things get executed in parallel when the call stack executes functions one by one.

Event-Loop and message queue into rescue. Event-Loop is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events and the Message queue is responsible for storing events that are running asynchronously.

Let's understand this with some code.

```js
// FUNCTION name called one
function one() {
  //log
  console.log('One')
}

// FUNCTION name called two
function Two() {
  //log
  console.log('Two')
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Hi, Iam web api')
  }, 3000)
}

// FUNCTION name called three
function Three() {
  //log
  console.log('Three')
}

one()
two()
three()
```

This time can you guess the output? If yes. Congratulations.

The Expeted Output is

```js
  one
  two
  three
  hi, iam webapi
```

This happens because the Web API (setTimeout()) function executes later point of out in the future.
But, Call Stack won't wait for setTimeout() execution and continue to its next line.

Once setTimeout() execution completes, Special Event will be stored inside the message queue with reference.
Event-Loop keeps checking for the events that are stored inside the message queue and send those events to the call stack for its execution.

That's how things are loading parallelly without waiting for other elements.

Hope it helps..

Happy coding.
