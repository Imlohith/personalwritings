## Overview

You are one of those who started learning to code in college days. So you picked web development as your toolkit. why? Because it's easy (Not really).

You covered the basics of web development and started applying for jobs. There are high chances that you get rejected. Why? I'll explain.

Tech recruiters especially startups look for candidates who can help on real projects rather than solving leet code problems.

So to fill that gap. You have to build your portfolio which will explain your skillset and projects that you already worked on. I'll mention some
real-world projects that will give an edge over other candidates. let's start.

### 1) Build Own Portolio

> > HTML and CSS are the tools to build a static site where it showcases your work and skillset as I mentioned earlier.

Build a portfolio with some cool animations and choose color grading properly if you are more into the frontend world.
There are so many services that will help you to serve your site through CDN (content delivery network) for free. You don't need to purchase any fancy domain and hosting like that.

Must include your GitHub profile and other social media links to easily get in touch with you.

### 2) API Integretion

> > API integrations are the most common day-to-day task for web developers. You'll get familiar with client/server architecture and HTTP protocol.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many APIs available on the internet for free.

### 3) CLONE (Amazon clone, Instagram clone, Netflix clone)

Build a project that is similar to the existing one. Focus on the core feature and don't stress about building every single feature.
Follow any tutorial on youTube. I highly recommend [Clever Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/c/CleverProgrammer)

I suggest you work for startups at least once in your career. Because you learned a lot about development, business, marketing, and sales.
You build more confidence that will surely help at a later point in time.

Happy coding!!
