# Deploying a Node.js Application in Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy to deploy and scale applications in the cloud. In this tutorial, I'll walk through the process of deploying a Node.js application to Elastic Beanstalk.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- AWS account
- The EB CLI installed
- Node.js application

## Step 1: Initialize your project

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your Node.js application directory.
2. Run the following command to initialize the project:

```
eb init --profile [aws-sdk named profile]
```

3. Follow the steps to select your region, application name, and environment name.

## Step 2: Create an environment

1. Run the following command to create an environment:

```
eb create --profile [aws-sdk named profile]
```

2. Follow the prompts to select your environment type, platform, and instance type.

## Step 3: Deploy your application

1. Run the following command to deploy your application to Elastic Beanstalk:

```
eb deploy --profile [aws-sdk named profile]
```

2. Wait for the deployment to complete.

## Step 4: View your application

1. Once the deployment is complete, run the following command to open your application in a browser:

```
eb open
```

### Behind the Scenes

1. The EB CLI uses Git to create a source bundle of your application code.
2. The source bundle is uploaded to an S3 bucket specified in your Elastic Beanstalk configuration.
3. Elastic Beanstalk retrieves the source bundle from the S3 bucket.
4. Elastic Beanstalk launches a new instances to handle the deployment.
5. Elastic Beanstalk deploys the source bundle to the new instances.
6. The old instances are terminated and the deployment is complete.

Congratulations! You successfully deployed your Node.js application to Elastic Beanstalk using the EB CLI.
