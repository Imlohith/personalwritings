## Overview

Benchmarking your code is a very important step to maintaining good code. It does not particularly matter whether the language is "fast" or "slow" as each language has its target platform where it needs to do well.

## JavaScript Benchmarking Code

In JavaScript there is a really simple way to measure the performance of your code and can be rally useful to test easily on the client side of your web browser.

Let's look at an example:

```js
function reallyExpensiveFunction() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
    console.log('Hi\n')
  }
}

console.time('reallyExpensiveFunction')
console.timeEnd('reallyExpensiveFunction')
```

We can bench our functions by using the function console.time to start and console.timeEnd to end our bench.

## Complex Benchmarking

- Profiling

  > What does a profiler actually do? A program profile gives the developer the ability to be able to measure both space and time complexity of their functions in their program. This is particularly important if your program has a major bottleneck causing slowdowns, which is especially disastrous if it is a system where many requests are made.

- Benchmarking IO Operations
  > IO operations are ones that take in user input or read or write to system files, mainly requiring operations from the operating system kernel. These operations are usually the most expensive operations in your program. However, since time spent in system calls is not manageable by the programmer, it is best to reduce the amount of system calls that are made to improve performance.

## Conclusion

In the end it's up to you how you choose to benchmark your code. Generally, you want to code your project before you benchmark it and if performance is really a concern then you can opt to use these benchmarking libraries or use a performance profile to find bottlenecks. I hope you learned something today :).
